# Lognormal-Strain-Distribution

Suitable for users to fit and analyze the distribution of DIC-based strain in a easy way.  
.txt files from VIC-2D or .mat file from Ncorr is required.

Note, lognormal distribution is not recommended for strain with a lot of negtive values.


Running the code
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just define the parameters (optional) and click run.


Functions of the code
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Plot strain maps based on Ncorr data.
2. Fit and plot strain based on lognormal distribution.
3. Compare the fitting results with DIC data.


Further Reference
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Strain is obtained from Ncorr or VIC-2D.  
Ncorr is recommended for further analysis since it is open-source.
